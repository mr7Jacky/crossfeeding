# Occurance of Stripe Pattern

#### Parameter Requirement: Diffusion A / Diffustion B >> Diffusion 1 / Diffusion

#### Comparasion

|--|--|--|
|diffusionB| **20** | **2** |
|diffusionA| **20** | **2** |

The main difference is diffusion A / B is 20:2.

Then we will observe two differet patterns

1. **[LEFT]** When the diffusion A /B = 20, where Diffusion A / Diffustion B >> Diffusion 1 / 2, we can observe a stripe pattern.
2. **[RIGHT]** When the diffusion A /B = 2, where Diffusion A / Diffustion B is close to Diffusion 1 / 2, we can observe a well-mixed pattern.

We can observe that the left one is growing into a stripe pattern and the right one we see a well-mixed pattern. 

#### Hypothesis (Mutualism without Toxicity)

When the diffusion of cells is much smaller than the diffusion of nutrients, the spread of cells is slower than the nutrient. In the mutualism, one type of cell will generate the nutrient feeding by another type of cell. As a consequence, the outter type of cells will generate nutrients for the inner type of cell. The width of the nutrient generated will be fixed as soon as the inner type of cells begin to grow in that region. Besides, in that region, there are only one type of nutrient (generated by outer type of cell). In this way, the stripe will stop grow at some point when they comsume all the nutrient at that region. 

In contrast to the first configuration, the second setting is have roughly the same diffusion velocity. In this scenario, the growth of two types of cells will be similar, since there is no such a region where only on type of nutrient is occupied. Thus, in each region, both types will occupy the at the same time in the region.

Conclusively, when the diffusion of cell is much larger than the diffusion of nutrient, we will observe the stripe pattern colony. We can assume that if we have a smaller diffusion of cells but set the diffusion of nutrient to 0, we can observe the similar pattern but of smaller population at same time.

#### Hypothesis (Mutualism with Toxicity)

Let's see the pattern (right figure) with the same parameter as the left one, but includes a toxcity B = 10 ([parameters](./src/param/diffAB20_tox.txt))

As we can observe, the type 1 overtly has a larger population compare to type 2, At the same time the stripe pattern become such a pattern with discontiguous dots in stead of curving linear stripes. Our assumption is that the loss of the continuous uni-type region stripe is due the toxicity of the nutrient. The colony of type 2 is shrinking into dots due to they are less tolerant to nutrient B. As a co-effect, the total population of type 2 is decreasing compare to the population of type 2 in the setting with no toxicity.

##### Plan

We will test the following parameter to verify our hypothesis (All three setting have a Diffusion 1 = Diffusion 2 = 0)

1. EQUAL TOXICITY: Diffusion A = Diffusion B = 10; Toxicity A = Toxicity B = 1
2. NO TOX: Diffusion A = Diffusion B = 10; Toxicity A = Toxicity B = 0
3. DIFFERENT TOX: Diffusion A = Diffusion B = 10; Toxicity A = 1; Toxicity B = 10
